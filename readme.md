  <h1>Pan Card Tampering Detection using Open CV With Deployment </h1>

  <p>

An image processing tampering detection model using OpenCV to detect whether the given id is valid or not. For this project, the Permanent Account Number has been taken but it can be used in different organizations for the verification of their ids.

The aim of this project is to utilize computer vision applications in fake identity detection.

## :signal_strength: Image

This project has a wide dataset scope but for the reference of example we have worked on Permanant Account Number issued for indians to verify their identity. The reference image looks like below:

</div>

## :toolbox: Dependecies

`python 3.8.3`

`sk.image`

`imutils`

`cv2`

`PIL`

`requests`


## :gear: Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smithjadhav/Pan-Card-Tampering-Detection-Using-Open-Cv-With-Deployment.git
```

```bash
cd Pan-Card-Tampering-Detection-Using-Open-Cv-With-Deployment
```



## :play_or_pause_button: Usage

The Jupyter notebook Pan_Card_Tampering_Detection.ipynb contains the code for loading and preprocessing the dataset, as well as implementing and evaluating the tampered as well as original image. To run the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter or Google Colab and run each cell in order.
<br/>
## :rocket: Results

<div align='center'>

Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between the tampered and original image is 31.67%.

</div>



## :construction: Conclusion

In this project, we understood the application of Structural Similarity Index in computer vision for detecting fake id's and shown the contours and threshold on the tampered and original image, also verfied the images with gray scaling. This project could be further applied to tackle the id's large industry dataset for making a tool to verify the employees id.
